# Gradient Descent from First Principles

An implementation of the gradient descent algorithm built from scratch, demonstrating the fundamental calculus concepts that power modern machine learning optimization.

## Project Overview

This project provides a ground-up implementation of gradient descent from first principlesâ€”without relying on pre-built optimization libraries. It includes:

* Visual demonstrations of critical concepts using 3D plots and contour analysis
* Step-by-step derivation of gradient calculations
* Pure Python implementation of gradient descent
* Interactive visualizations of the optimization process
* Comprehensive mathematical explanations with practical examples

## Key Features

* Custom implementation of numerical partial derivatives
* Visualization of local linearity and its role in optimization
* Interactive 3D surface plots with gradient descent paths
* Detailed explanation of learning rates and their impact
* No dependencies on machine learning libraries for core algorithm

## Tools & Technologies

Required dependencies:
```python
numpy
matplotlib
plotly
```

## Future Improvements

* Extend implementation of different optimization algorithms (Adam, RMSprop)
* Add additional test functions and visualization options
